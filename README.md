# CarPark 🚗

**CarPark** is a smart and automated parking management system designed to revolutionize the way vehicles enter and exit parking facilities. Inspired by FASTag technology, CarPark eliminates manual intervention and long wait times by providing a QR-based check-in and check-out system for seamless access control.

With CarPark, users can generate a unique QR code linked to their vehicle number and owner details, which gets scanned at the entry and exit points for instant verification and hassle-free parking. This contactless and automated system enhances security, reduces congestion, and improves the overall parking experience.
